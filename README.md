# Go Breakout ðŸ”¨
I am in the process of learning Golang and to do so I am building a small [breakout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)) game directly in the terminal!
The game uses [tcell](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/tree/main) which is a Go package that provides a grid based view for terminals which will handle all the rendering of game entities.
